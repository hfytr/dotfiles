>[!WARNING]
> It's happening! Firefox developers have [officially introduced Vertical Tabs](https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/firefox-sidebar-and-vertical-tabs-try-them-out-in-nightly/m-p/63231#M22243)!
>
> You may or may not have noticed, but many custom themes that target tabs have broken recently. This is because - as of Firefox version 131, Firefox has made their own vertical tabs implementation. Firefox's implementation is missing a lot, the spacing is extreme.. auto-hiding tabs isn't a thing, etc, etc, but most importantly.. This forces a bit of a reset onto the FF Ultima theme.
>
> As the developers continue to make progress, the theme will only improve, while restoring many of the lost features.
>
> Returning Users will need to delete some of the old ultima settings, or just make a new firefox profile, and use your user.js file to get the new settings. Read the change log!

- All prior positioning bugs, Fullscreen effects on Mac, have been corrected
